            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the 
            pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the 
            State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque his 
            mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
            between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers
            and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous
            properties and large tracts of land.<br><br> Their business had involved trading groceries between the 
            mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland
            and Pamban. As a result, the family acquired the title of "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat 
            steerers), which over the years became shortened to "Marakier." With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
            to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were 
            lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.[19] By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become 
            poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.</p><br><br>

            <p class="para"><b><u>Career as a Scientist</u></b><br>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical 
            Development Establishment of the Defece Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development
            Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his 
            choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, 
            the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which 
            successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work 
            on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's
            approval and expanded theprogramme to include more engineers.<br><br>
            Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research
            and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted
            during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the 
            Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.Media coverage of
            Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.However, the director of the 
            site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing
            an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.<br><br>

            In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".
             In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</p>
